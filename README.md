My scene was originally intended to be a cyberpunk alleyway. Due to time constraints I ended up settling on a sort of open bunker. I included a lot of crates and sci-fi objects, as well as some lights to keep it from being totally dark, especially because I wanted more dark or muted colors. A primary inspiration came from Cyberpunk Edgerunners, a really good cyberpunk anime that came out when I was doing the project. Outside of the whole aesthetic, I was just getting back into a cyberpunk phase. The actual thing I came up  with resembles an idea of a bunker for a found family type mercenary or rebel group that have a casual abiet armed or industrial vibe. The main character was a girl that I wanted to be a cyborg, but again, time constraints. I have dubbed her the Braid Girl in loving memory of every single one I had to attach to a curve and independently append on her.
